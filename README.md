# Crop Prediction and Recommendation

## ABSTRACT

The analysis focuses on predicting crop yield based on weather conditions, soil characteristics, and farming practices.  
The dataset includes multiple crops across different states and seasons, considering factors such as area cultivated, production volume, annual rainfall, fertilizer use, and pesticide application.  
Machine learning models will be employed to predict crop yield, helping optimize resource allocation and improve decision-making for sustainable farming.  
The findings aim to enhance agricultural planning and precision farming techniques.

## DATA PREPROCESSING

<span style="color:red"><strong>This text will be red</strong></span>

- **Handle Missing Data** – Fill missing values using average (mean/median) or advanced techniques.  
- **Select Important Features** – Keep only the most useful data that affects crop yield.  
- **Normalize Data** – Scale numbers (e.g., rainfall, fertilizer) so they are in a similar range.  
- **Convert Text to Numbers** – Change crop names, seasons, and states into numerical values.  
- **Balance the Data** – Ensure fair distribution of all crops to avoid bias.  
- **Split Data for Training & Testing** – Use 70–80% of data for training and 20–30% for testing.  
- **Reduce Complexity (if needed)** – Simplify data using special techniques to make the model faster.
